**Note:** A companion library <a href="https://github.com/vindar/tgx-font">tgx-font</a> provides a collection of plain and anti-aliased fonts which can be used with this library.

## 2D and 3D graphics library for 32bits microcontrollers. 

This library implements a sets of classes that makes it easy to draw 2D and 3D graphics onto a memory framebuffer. The library is aimed and optimized toward 32bits MCUs yet it is cross-platform and also works on CPUs. 

The library has been currently tested on:
- Teensy 3.5, 3.6, 4.0, 4.1
- ESP32
- desktop CPUs

**Warning:** The library's goal is to draw graphics **on  a memory framebuffer**. As such, it does not provide  any hardware/screen support. You will need a screen driver to display the memory framebuffer onto a physical screen. If you are using a Teensy 4.0/4.1 and an ILI9341 screen, you may consider using my [optimized driver](https://github.com/vindar/ILI9341_T4).

Here are the library main features.

### 2D graphics.

- Support for multiple color types: `RGB565`, `RGB24`, `RGB32`, `RGB64`, `RGBf` and `HSV`. Every 2D/3D drawing operation is available for each color type. 
- Template `Image` class that encapsulates a memory framebuffer and enables the creation of sub-images (i.e. views) that share the same buffer. This provides an elegant and efficient way to clip of all drawing operations to a particular region. 
- API (mostly) compatible with [Adafruit's GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) and [Bodmer's TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) libraries, but with more drawing primitives and usually faster ! Primitives for drawing lines, triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipses...
- Methods for blitting sprites with or without a transparent mask, with rotation and scaling. High quality drawing is achieved using bilinear filtering and sub-pixel precision for very smooth animations.  
- Image color type conversion and resizing.
- Transparency supported for all drawing methods. The color types `RGB32` and `RGB64` have an alpha channel used for alpha blending. 
- Anti-aliased methods for drawing thick lines and circles. 
- Support for Adafruit's fonts as well as PJRC's ILI9341_t3 v1 and v2.3 anti-aliased fonts (see also <a href="https://github.com/vindar/tgx-font">tgx-font</a>).
- Python script to convert an image to a C file that can be directly imported into a project.

### 3D graphics.

- Heavily optimized "pixel perfect" triangle rasterizer with 8bits sub-pixels precision. 
- Depth buffer testing. 
- Flat and Gouraud shading.
- Phong lightning model with separate ambient/diffuse/specular color components (currently only one directional light source). 
- Per object material properties. 
- Perspective-correct texture mapping with selectable point sampling / bilinear filtering.
- Perspective and Orthographic projection. 
- Optional backface culling.
- Tile rasterization: it is possible to render only part of the viewport at a time to save RAM by using a smaller image and a smaller zbuffer. 
- Templates classes for all the needed maths: `Vec2`, `Vec3`, `Vec4` (vectors), `Mat4` (4x4 matrix) and `Box2` (2D box). 
- Optimized mesh data format: meshes and textures can be read directly from flash memory to save RAM.
- Python scripts for easy conversion of texture images and 3D meshes (in Wavefront's .obj format) into C files that can be directly imported into an Arduino project. 

## Using the library. 

**TODO**

- Documentation available in the docstrings located in the header files. 

- Basic library usage can be found by looking at the examples located in the `/examples` sub-directory.

- Python conversion scripts needed to import meshes and textures are  located in the `/tools` sub-directory.
